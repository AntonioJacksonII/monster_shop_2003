# Monster Shop
BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project

## Background and Description

"Monster Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Users who work for a merchant can mark their items as 'fulfilled'; the last merchant to mark items in an order as 'fulfilled' will be able to get "shipped" by an admin. Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

Students will be put into 3 or 4 person groups to complete the project.\n

## DTR
- During our initial DTR process, there were similar themes in our goals such as becoming more comfortable with Active Record and Authorization. Over time and as we neared the end of the project, we were able to focus more on individual goals, such as practicing refactoring skills.

## Project Management & Workflow
- For this project, we decided to use Trello to organize the work: https://trello.com/b/NmzD8hxd/monster-shop-board
- Throughout most of the project, we worked as pairs tackling sections at a time, where each took different user stories and would build the functionality. After, each would review the other's work, put in a Pull Request to the rest of the team, who would then review the completed section together, and merge to master.

## Heroku

## Group Member Experiences
```
I was really uncomfortable with creating many to many relationships/migrations and I feel confident about them now! I also feel was more comfortable creating objects in tests with a joins table.
- Madeleine
```

```
Challenges:  My challenges going into the project were working with ActiveRecord, understanding/implementing the Model View Controller design pattern, and creating many-to-many relationships. Working through the project, I definitely feel more comfortable with ActiveRecord and many-to-many relationships, but I am still iffy about whether or not I am adhering to MVC design.
- Antonio
```

```
It was a challenge learning and implementing namespacing/authorization, but through this project I feel I have a much firmer understanding. ActiveRecord is also an area of weakness, and working through some of the more challenging queries with team members has helped me grow at it. Finally, knowing when to stay REstFul and when to add extra actions to a controller is still confusing.
- Taylor
```

```
My overarching goal for this project, was to feel more comfortable working independently, within a group dynamic. After this experience, I feel more confident in my skills and resourcefulness. Something that I've been looking forward to is understanding how data is accessed/passed, and I feel that implementing namespacing with the group, really helped me understand this better. One of my challenges remains to be Active Record, but I'm confident I will get it.

## Future Improvements/Implementations
- Implement partials to DRY up views
- More edge case testing
- Implement resources and utilize path helpers
